  <h3>WT_4_365 - UV irradiation (365 nm)</h3>
  <p>This unit was WaveyTech's first and most successful unit. Designed primarily for the irradiation of diazirine moeities,
    although it has been successfully implemented in photo-switching applications to. Any application which requires powerful irradiation
    at 365 nm, then this is the unit for you!<br/><br/>

    This unit contains four powerful UV LEDs (365 nm) for simultaneous sample exposure.
    - It is highly portable
    - It is safe, with design to ensure no stray irradation escapes the unit during operation
    - LEDs are supported by a heat quality alumminium housing and heatsinks to draw what little heat is generated away from your samples.
    Keeping them fresher for longer compared to irradiators using bulbs.
    - Fast irradiation times.</p>

  <h3>WT_4_457 - Blue irradiation (457 nm)</h3>
  <p>This unit is the newest addition to WaveyTech's product list. Designed primarily for the irradiation of diazirine moeities, using
    the emerging micro-map technology.<br/><br/>

    All the benefits and features of the UV unit - but with a new wavelength.

    This wavelength was also highly applicable to the photo-switching reactions, utilised in this peer-reviewed
    research completed by the Tate Research Group. </p>
